* Level 2: Sell You make the design decision and show the team why it is the right call.
* Level 3: Consult You ask the team for input before making the design decision. Ultimately the decision is still yours.
* Level 4: Agree You collaborate with your team and reach consensus about the design decision as a group. Everyone has an equal voice.
* Level 5: Advise You influence the team by sharing your opinions and insights but let someone else make the design decision.
* Level 6: Inquire You let the team make the design decision and ask them to show why their decision is the right one.
