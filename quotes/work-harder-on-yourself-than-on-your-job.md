title: Jim Rohn - Success is something you attract
---

Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job.
If you work hard on your job, you can make a living.
If you work hard on yourself, you make a fortune.

Success is something you attract, by becoming an attractive person.
Success is not something you pursue, it's something you attract, by becoming attractive.
