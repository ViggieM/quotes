When you have some skills but don't fully understand your environment, there is no way you can be a plus one.
At best you can be a zero.
But a zero is not a bad thing to be.
You're competent enough not to create problems or make more work for everyone else.
And you have to be competent, and prove to others that you are, before you can be extraordinary.
There are no shortcuts, unfortunately.
